> This project was made as a part of my Game Development Workshop V class.

## About

A [Minicraft](https://minicraftplus.github.io/) clone built using Hatred.

## What is Hatred?

It's an engine built around another engine. The engine in question being [pygame - Community Edition](https://pypi.org/project/pygame-ce/) (some people call it a framework, I just call it an engine since it suites my defintion.)

> My definition of an engine: Any library or GUI based editor that can give my some support when working on games.

## Progress Checks

I have created a Kanban chart in Trello so anybody can check how the progress for the game is looking: https://trello.com/b/7uDdfspz/flat-adventures
