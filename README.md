## About

A [Minicraft](https://minicraftplus.github.io/) clone built using Hatred.

## What is Hatred?

It's an engine built around another engine. The engine in question being [PyGame - Community Edition](https://pypi.org/project/pygame-ce/) (some people call it a framework, I just call it an engine since it suites my defintion.)
